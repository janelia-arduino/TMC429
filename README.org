** Description

The Trinamic TMC429 is a triple-axis dedicated step and direction motion
controller for both position and velocity control with acceleration and
deceleration trapezoidal ramps.

* Stepper Motors

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:

A stepper motor, also known as step motor or stepping motor, is a brushless DC
electric motor that divides a full rotation into a number of equal steps. The
motor's position can be commanded to move and hold at one of these steps without
any position sensor for feedback (an open-loop controller), as long as the motor
is correctly sized to the application in respect to torque and speed.

* Stepper Motor Controllers and Drivers

Stepper motors need both a controller and a driver. These may be combined into a
single component or separated into multiple components that communicate with
each other, as is the case with the TMC429 stepper motor controller. One
controller may be connected to more than one driver for coordinated multi-axis
motion control.

** Stepper Motor Controller

A stepper motor controller is responsible for the commanding either the motor
kinetics, the torque, or the motor kinematics, the position, speed, and
acceleration of one or more stepper motors.

** Stepper Motor Driver

A stepper motor driver is responsible for commanding the electrical current
through the motor coils as it changes with time to meet the requirements of the
stepper motor controller.

*** Required

- Power supply (3.3V or 5V)
- Clock (4-32MHz)
- SPI to microcontroller (MOSI, MISO, SCK, CS)
- Step and Direction signals to each of the stepper drivers

*** Optional
